### Description:
Diet_Tumblr will be a social media based app with very limited features. Youll be able to login and out as a user, like and comment on photos and reblog them to your own profile. This app is made for bloggers who log to share their thoughts digitally 

### User Story:

1.  The user first sees the log in page. They are given the option to sign in or sign up.

2.  Once logged in the user's home page greets them. It also reveals the navigation bar.

3.  The navigation bar offers 3 choices:

    a. Logout

    b. Profile

    c. Dashboard

4.  The user's profile displays a varity of post and likes that the user has added to their page.

5.  The user can create post via clicking "post" on the dashboard.

6.  Log out returns you to the sign in page.

### MVP:

1. 4 pages in Schema (Login, Profile, Dashboard & Logout).

2. oAuth for a secure login.

3. Post save to profile and user can create post via Dashboard

4. A nav bar with routes.

5. A log out page that removes you oauth data, and routes you back to the login page.

### Stretch:

1. Set up commenting on post

2. Music on profile page

3. User can upload their own profile pictures

### Routes:

Login "/login"

Dashboard "/"
